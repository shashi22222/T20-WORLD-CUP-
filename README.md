# T20-WORLD-CUP-
PREDICTION ON 2021 WORLD CUP
Twenty-20 world cup is the international championship , which is organized by ICC .In this game two teams of 11 Players ,Which has maximum 20 Overs . It has gained popularity since recent years from till now. For this T20 prediction is done to predict the results of game . In this system they only considered previous performances ,rating and clustering of players . This leads to facing problems like Low accuracy , limited dataset and getting incorrect prediction results .To overcome this problem, In our project we are using four-five algorithms by considering parameters such as previous performances , Ranking and Rating of teams , venue and pitch conditions. We compare each of these parameters by using algorithms such as logistic regression , Random forest, KNN, Decision tree ,Naive bayes.

#Modules used in project.


Tensorflow:
TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library, and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks. It is used for both research and production at Google. 
Numpy:
Numpy is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays.
It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains various features including these important ones:
->	A powerful N-dimensional array object
->Sophisticated (broadcasting) functions.
Pandas:
Pandas is an open-source Python Library providing high-performance data manipulation and analysis tool using its powerful data structures. Python was majorly used for data munging and preparation. It had very little contribution towards data analysis. Pandas solved this problem. Using Pandas, we can accomplish five typical steps in the processing and analysis of data, regardless of the origin of data load, prepare, manipulate, model, and analyze. Python with Pandas is used in a wide range of fields including academic and commercial domains including finance, economics, Statistics, analytics, etc.
Matplotlib:
Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shells, the Jupyter Notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits. Matplotlib tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible. You can generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, error charts, scatter plots, etc., with just a few lines of code. For examples, see the sample plots and thumbnail gallery.
Scikit – learn:
Scikit-learn provides a range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms via a consistent interface in Python. It is licensed under a permissive simplified BSD license and is distributed under many Linux distributions, encouraging academic and commercial use. Python.
